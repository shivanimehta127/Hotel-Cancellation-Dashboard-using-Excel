**• Interactive Filters:** The dashboard allows users to filter data by various factors like customer segments, booking sources, or geographical location.

**• Data Integrity & Accuracy:** The dashboard ensures high accuracy by integrating clean and well-structured datasets, preventing errors in analysis.

**• User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with a simple yet effective user interface to make it easy for non-technical users, such as hotel managers, to interpret the data without needing advanced Excel knowledge.

## Technical Aspects:
**• Excel Functions & Formulas:** Utilizes advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, SUMIF, COUNTIF, and IF statements to clean, process, and analyze data.

**• Pivot Tables:** Incorporates PivotTables to quickly summarize and analyze large datasets, making the dashboard dynamic and adaptable to different views.

**• Data Visualization Tools:** Conditional formatting, charts, and graphs enhance the readability and accessibility of the data.
